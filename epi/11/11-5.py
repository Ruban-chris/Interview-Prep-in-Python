# You want to compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. The sequence is presented to you 
# in a streaming fashion.  You cannot back up to read an earlier value, and you
# need to output the median after reading in each new element. Fox example,
# if the input is 1, 0, 3, 5, 2, 0, 1 the output is 1, 0.5, 1, 2, 2, 1.5, 1.

# Design an algorithm for computing the running median of a sequence.

# if n is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers
# if n is odd, the median is the middle number
