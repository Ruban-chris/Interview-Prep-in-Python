# The three sum problem

# Design an algorithm that takes as input an array and a number, and determins if there are three entries in the array 
# not necessarily distinct) which add up to the specified number. For example, 
# if the array is <11, 2, 5, 7, 3> then there are three entries in the array which add up to 21. [3,7, 11] and [5,5,11]

# We can use a value twice.
